#TweakBattles

[Tweak Battles](https://www.tweakbattles.com), as Zac Gorak the creater put it, is "...te demon-child of the original [Tweak Week](https://tweakweek.com/) by [@rpetrich](https://twitter.com/rpetrich)". During TweakBattles developers compete against each other in releasing one open source tweak within a week and claiming all-time glory.

##My Own Challenge
During the last TweakBattle I teamed up with Ben Rosen and ultimately ended up disqualified due to failure to complte in time. This time around I want to challenge myself to go further than whats required.

I will be creating not one, not two, but seven open-source tweaks starting on 5/18/15 and edning on 5/25/15. Although I'll be creating seven to challenge myself, I will only be officialy using one of them for the battle.
