#TweakBattles

[Tweak Battles](https://www.tweakbattles.com), as Zac Gorak the creater put it, is "...the demon-child of the original [Tweak Week](https://tweakweek.com/) by [@rpetrich](https://twitter.com/rpetrich)". During TweakBattles developers compete against each other in releasing one open source tweak within a week and claiming all-time glory.

##My Own Challenge
During the last TweakBattle I teamed up with Ben Rosen and ultimately ended up disqualified due to failure to complete in time. This time around I want to challenge myself to go further than whats required.

I will be creating not one, not two, but seven open-source tweaks starting on 5/18/15 and ending on 5/25/15. Although I'll be creating seven to challenge myself, I will only be officially using one of them for the battle.

### Releases

2 - SafariWallSetter  
3 - SpotCleaner  
4 - TBD  
5 - TBD  
6 - TBD
